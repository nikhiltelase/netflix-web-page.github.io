# **Netflix Front Page**

This repository contains the code for recreating the front page style of Netflix using HTML and CSS. This project was undertaken as a learning exercise to delve into web development concepts and refine skills in HTML and CSS.

### Project Overview
The aim of this project was to replicate the design and layout of the Netflix front page, focusing on creating an immersive user experience akin to the original site. While the primary focus was on desktop and laptop viewing, the project is not currently optimized for mobile responsiveness.

### Project Structure
